# Better-Fuel-Management


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.


* Fuel containers do not automatically vanish when they are empty.

* Fuel containers do not automatically appear when they are needed.

* If an action produces (e.g. cooking fish) or retrieves (e.g. harvesting a Kerosene Lamp) fuel and there is no appropriate container with sufficient capacity in the inventory, that fuel will be lost. You will need to manage your empty fuel containers!

* The fuel in the Storm Lantern can be drained again.

* Transfer fuel between fuel containers.

* A custom radial menu has been added to make placing fuel containers easier. You can change the key or disable the menu in the Mod Settings.

* Clicking on a fuel container in the inventory will set it to full condition. This does not affect gameplay significantly, but can make the refilling more impartial.

## Localizations

You can help make Better-Fuel-Management even better! Better-Fuel-Management only has localized text for 7 languages.

It is missing localized text for `Korean`, `Simplified Chinese`, `Traditional Chinese`, `Norwegian`, `Portuguese (Portugal)`, `Portuguese (Brazil)`, `Italian`, and `Ukrainian`. 

If you know any of these languages, you can contribute by translating the eight lines below and sending them to me.

"No containers with remaining capacity available"

"Drain"

"Draining..."

"Lost" (a verb meaning wasted)

"Already empty"

"Already full"

"Gas Can" (meaning gasolene canister) - this is new and needs localized for all localizations

"An old gas can. Holds kerosene just as well." - this is new and needs localized for all localizations
