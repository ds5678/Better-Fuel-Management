# Better-Fuel-Management


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.


* Fuel containers do not automatically vanish when they are empty.

* Fuel containers do not automatically appear when they are needed.

* If an action produces (e.g. cooking fish) or retrieves (e.g. harvesting a Kerosene Lamp) fuel and there is no appropriate container with sufficient capacity in the inventory, that fuel will be lost. You will need to manage your empty fuel containers!

* The fuel in the Storm Lantern can be drained again.

* Transfer fuel between fuel containers.

* A custom radial menu has been added to make placing fuel containers easier. You can change the key or disable the menu in the Mod Settings.

* Clicking on a fuel container in the inventory will restore it to full condition. This does not affect gameplay significantly.
